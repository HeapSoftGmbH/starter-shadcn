# Create new next.js page

## Translation

New pages should have their own translation object, like the `Home` object in [en.json](mdc:messages/en.json). Also provide the client messages using the `TranslationsProvider` component. It takes namespaces, include the newly created namespace for the page and also always inlcude the `common` namespace.

## Metadata

Pages need page metadata, this includes title and description e.g. [page.tsx](mdc:src/app/[locale]/page.tsx).
